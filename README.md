# Dendritic Crystal Growth
This repository contains MATLAB implementation for isotropic and anisotropic dendritic crystal growth as proposed by Kobayashi in "Modeling and numerical simulations of dendritic crystal growth"
A code was written that solves the two equations - one for temperature evolution and one for phase field evolution as given in the Kobayashi's paper. Explicit method for temperature equation and explicit time marching scheme for phase field simulation have been used.
Since I'm solving for isotropic growth, I use the isotropic version of the phase field equation.
